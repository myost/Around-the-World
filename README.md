# Around-the-World
## What?
Around the World is a simple app that uses GraphQL and the @trevorblades [Countries API](https://github.com/trevorblades/countries) to fetch data on countries and continents with the help of the [Apollo iOS](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios) framework. Then it uses the pattern from [Modern MVVM](https://github.com/V8tr/ModernMVVM) and [Combine]() to process and display that data in a swift app written in SwiftUI.
## Why?
The frameworks and languages used to create this app are relatively new to the world of iPhone app development. In order to understand them all better I did what most any developer would probably do, start coding. To create this project I spent plenty of days pouring over all kinds of documentation, wrapping my head around the different concepts and then putting them to use. And now you get to see the result.
